DAO design pattern 
Data Access Object Pattern or DAO pattern is used to separate low level data accessing API or operations from high level business services. Following are the participants in Data Access Object Pattern.

Data Access Object Interface - This interface defines the standard operations to be performed on a model object(s).

Data Access Object concrete class - This class implements above interface. This class is responsible to get data from a data source which can be database / xml or any other storage mechanism.

Model Object or Value Object - This object is simple POJO containing get/set methods to store data retrieved using DAO class.



The DAO provides the encapsulation of the database-specific code, that is, it is isolated from the main program.
The DTO acts as a data store that moves the data from one layer to another.
Both DAO and DTO can be combined to make a more maintainable code.
The use of DAO and DTO makes it easy during the testing phase, as these are separated from the main code.
